        The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the
        objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the
        gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast
        majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the
        remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. The four inner system
        planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being
        composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the
        outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the
        terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being
        composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and
        Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances
        with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium,
        such as water, ammonia, and methane. All eight planets have nearly
        circular orbits that lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, called the
        ecliptic.

          The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
          perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
          reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light,
          ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. It is the most important source
          of energy for life on Earth. The Sun's diameter is about 1.39 million
          kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is
          about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the
          total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's
          mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%),
          with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen,
          carbon, neon, and iron.

          Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
          the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
          of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
          (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator
          between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes
          (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
          inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from
          Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet
          can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern
          horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may
          appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe
          than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the
          complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs
          over its synodic period of approximately 116 days

          Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman
          goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's
          night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to
          the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller than that of
          Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a
          day-night cycle, it is most readily visible for up to a few hours
          following the start of sunset or before sunrise. At times, it has been
          seen in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth
          days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal
          rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to
          rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and
          does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that
          the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. Venus
          does not have any moons.

          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
          object known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found
          throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
          About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
          polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is
          land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is
          formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to
          produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid
          outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's
          magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds. Earth's atmosphere
          consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received
          by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by
          atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely present in
          the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover the planet.

          Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
          System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
          that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but
          slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the
          third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
          and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was
          named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods. Jupiter is
          primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of
          its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It probably has a rocky core of
          heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in the Solar
          System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction
          of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than it receives from the
          Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate
          spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator.

          composed of a core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
          compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic
          hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium,
          and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due
          to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current
          within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's
          planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has
          a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.

          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to
          the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology,
          was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus
          (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest
          planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar
          System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have
          bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas
          giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify
          Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other
          giant planets. As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined
          "solid surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and
          Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it
          contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with
          traces of other hydrocarbons

          Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar
          planet. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
          diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
          It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its
          near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus
          because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
          atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice
          giant planets (the other one being Uranus). Being composed primarily
          of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined "solid surface". The
          planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of
          30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman
          god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing
          Neptune's trident.

        The Edge of <span class="highlighter">SOLAR SYSTEM </span>

        Past the Kuiper Belt is the very edge of the solar system, the
        heliosphere, a vast, teardrop-shaped region of space containing
        electrically charged particles given off by the sun. Many astronomers
        think that the limit of the heliosphere, known as the heliopause, is
        about 9 billion miles (15 billion km) from the sun. The Oort Cloud lies
        well past the Kuiper Belt, considered to be located between 2,000 and
        5,000 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. The outer edge of the Oort
        Cloud may reach as far as 10,000 up to 100,000 AU from the sun. One AU
        is equal to approximately 93,000,000 miles (150 million kilometers). The
        Oort Cloud is home to billions, or even trillions of objects, according
        to NASA Science(opens in new tab).
